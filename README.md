# Resume-Checker
NLP based project to check you resume is perfectly going or not with your applying job!!

ðŸ”¹ Overview

This project is an AI-based resume analysis tool that evaluates how well a candidateâ€™s resume matches a given job description. It extracts text from PDF resumes, processes the job description, and calculates a match score along with skill gap analysis.

The system leverages NLP and ML techniques to highlight missing skills and provide actionable suggestions for resume improvement.



ðŸ”¹ **Features**

ðŸ“‚ Resume Parsing: Extracts text from resumes using pdfplumber.

ðŸ§  NLP Processing: Uses spaCy and NLTK for tokenization, named entity recognition, and keyword extraction.

ðŸ”Ž Semantic Similarity: Employs sentence-transformers to measure similarity between resume content and job requirements.

ðŸ“Š Machine Learning: scikit-learn used for feature extraction (TF-IDF, cosine similarity) and match scoring.

ðŸ“ˆ Skill Gap Analysis: Identifies missing or weak skills in the resume compared to job description.

âš¡ Easy Integration: Can be extended for ATS (Applicant Tracking System) or HR platforms.
